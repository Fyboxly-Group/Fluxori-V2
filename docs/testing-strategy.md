# Fluxori-V2 Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Fluxori-V2 project.

## Testing Approach

The Fluxori-V2 project uses a comprehensive testing approach with the following test types:

### Backend Tests

#### Unit Tests

- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on business logic and edge cases
- Fast execution for quick feedback

#### Integration Tests 

- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Use in-memory MongoDB for data persistence
- Verify request/response cycles
- Test authentication and authorization
- Test error handling

#### Service Tests

- Test business logic in service classes
- Verify data processing flows
- Test database interactions
- Test error handling

### Frontend Tests

#### Component Tests

- Test individual React components in isolation 
- Verify UI behavior and interactions
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on component-specific logic

#### End-to-End Tests

- Test complete user flows
- Verify frontend and backend integration
- Run against a test environment
- Focus on critical business flows

## Test Pyramid

We follow the test pyramid approach:

```
    /\
   /  \
  /    \
 / E2E  \
/--------\
/ Integration \
/----------------\
/      Unit       \
```

- Many unit tests for broad coverage
- Fewer integration tests for key flows
- Minimal E2E tests for critical paths

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Backend

- Global: 70% minimum (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- Controllers: 80% minimum
- Services: 75-80% minimum

### Frontend

- Components: 70% minimum
- Pages: 60% minimum
- Utilities: 80% minimum

## Testing Tools

### Backend

- Jest for test framework
- Supertest for API testing
- MongoDB Memory Server for database testing
- Jest Mocks for dependency isolation

### Frontend

- React Testing Library
- Jest
- Playwright for E2E tests
- Storybook for component testing

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Unit and integration tests run on every PR
2. End-to-end tests run on staging before deployment to production
3. Test coverage reports are generated and stored as artifacts
4. PRs with failing tests or insufficient coverage are blocked

## Test Data Strategy

- Use factories to generate test data
- Consistent naming conventions (e.g., "Test User")
- Reset data between tests for isolation
- Use seeders for integration and E2E tests

## Test Development Workflow

1. Write tests before or alongside code (TDD/BDD approach)
2. Run tests locally before pushing changes
3. Review test coverage reports regularly
4. Refactor tests as needed to improve maintainability

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regular review of test coverage
- Update tests as requirements change
- Monitor test execution time in CI pipeline
- Investigate and fix flaky tests promptly

## Documentation

- All test files should have clear descriptions
- Complex test scenarios should be documented
- Test templates are provided for consistency
- This testing strategy document is maintained as a living document
