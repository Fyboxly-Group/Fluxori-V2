# Mantine + GSAP Implementation Plan for Fluxori-V2 Frontend

This document outlines the implementation strategy, progress tracking, and motion design principles for the new Fluxori-V2 frontend built with Mantine UI and GSAP animations.

## Overview

We're building a fresh frontend using Mantine UI components and GSAP animations to replace the existing Chakra UI implementation. This approach addresses technical debt, provides a more modern user experience, and enables sophisticated animations with premium GSAP plugins.

## Motion Design Language

Our motion design language is built on three core principles:

### 1. Purposeful Intelligence

Animations communicate meaning and intention, guiding users through the interface and providing feedback:
- **Informative Motion**: Animations reflect system status and guide attention
- **Context Transitions**: Movement between states preserves context
- **Responsive Feedback**: Immediate visual responses to user actions
- **Hierarchy of Motion**: More important elements receive more pronounced animations

### 2. Fluid Efficiency

Animations are smooth and efficient, optimized for performance across devices:
- **Performance-First**: All animations are optimized for minimal CPU/GPU impact
- **Natural Physics**: Movement follows natural physics (appropriate easing, momentum)
- **Consistent Timing**: Similar actions have consistent animation durations
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Respects user preferences for reduced motion

### 3. Precision & Accuracy

Animations are exact and intentional with carefully calibrated timing:
- **Calibrated Timing**: 300-500ms for primary animations, 150-250ms for micro-interactions
- **Purposeful Easing**: Appropriate curves for different animation types
- **Coordinated Sequences**: Related elements animate in coordinated sequences
- **Pixel-Perfect Motion**: Animations move exactly as designed with no unintended artifacts

## GSAP Usage Guidelines

### Animation Timing

- **Primary transitions**: 400-600ms
- **Secondary transitions**: 300-400ms
- **Micro-interactions**: 150-250ms
- **Text animations**: 30-50ms per character
- **Stagger amounts**: 30-80ms between elements

### Easing Functions

- **Standard transitions**: `power2.out`
- **Emphasis animations**: `back.out(1.7)`
- **Subtle effects**: `power1.inOut`
- **Bouncy effects**: `elastic.out(1, 0.3)`
- **Natural motion**: `power3.out`

### Animation Choreography

1. **Enter animations**: Fade + translate or scale
2. **Exit animations**: Fade + subtle movement
3. **Focus animations**: Scale + highlight
4. **Error states**: Shake + highlight
5. **Success states**: Pop + checkmark

### Performance Considerations

- Use `willChange` properties
- Animate CSS transforms and opacity where possible
- Implement FLIP animations for layout changes
- Use staggered animations for large lists
- Enable hardware acceleration for complex animations
- Debounce scroll-triggered animations

## Motion Design Reference Examples

### Subtle Feedback

```typescript
// Button press effect
gsap.timeline()
  .to(button, {
    scale: 0.95,
    duration: 0.1,
    ease: 'power2.in'
  })
  .to(button, {
    scale: 1,
    duration: 0.2,
    ease: 'elastic.out(1.2, 0.5)'
  });
```

### State Transitions

```typescript
// Card expansion
gsap.to(card, {
  height: 'auto',
  paddingBottom: 16,
  duration: 0.4,
  ease: 'power2.out',
  onComplete: () => {
    // Show additional content
    gsap.fromTo(
      content, 
      { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
      { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 0.3 }
    );
  }
});
```

### Sequenced Animations

```typescript
// Form submission success
const timeline = gsap.timeline();

timeline
  .to(form, {
    opacity: 0.5,
    scale: 0.98,
    duration: 0.3,
    ease: 'power2.in'
  })
  .to(checkmark, {
    scale: 1,
    opacity: 1,
    duration: 0.5,
    ease: 'elastic.out(1, 0.5)'
  })
  .to(successMessage, {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    duration: 0.4,
    ease: 'power2.out'
  });
```
