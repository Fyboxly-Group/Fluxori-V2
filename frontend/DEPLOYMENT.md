## Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure you have:

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- Access to cloud deployment platform (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
- Environment variables for API endpoints and third-party services
- Access to the Fluxori V2 backend API
- SSL certificates (for production)

## Environment Configuration

The application requires the following environment variables:

```
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_VERSION=v2

# Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN=auth.example.com

# Feature Flags
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_AI_FEATURES=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true

# Performance Monitoring
NEXT_PUBLIC_ERROR_REPORTING_ENDPOINT=https://errors.example.com/report
NEXT_PUBLIC_PERFORMANCE_SAMPLING_RATE=0.1

# Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-XXXXXXXXX-X

# GSAP License
GSAP_LICENSE_KEY=your-gsap-business-license-key
```

Create environment-specific files:
- `.env.development` - Development environment
- `.env.test` - Testing environment
- `.env.production` - Production environment

## Build Process

The application uses Next.js's optimized build process:

1. Install dependencies: `npm ci`
2. Run linting and type checking: `npm run lint && npm run typecheck`
3. Run tests: `npm run test:ci`
4. Build the application: `npm run build:optimized`
5. Test the production build: `npm run start`

The build process includes:
- Transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript
- Bundling and code splitting
- Tree shaking to eliminate unused code
- Static asset optimization
- Generation of static pages where possible

## Deployment Options

### Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the recommended platform for deploying Next.js applications:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build:optimized`
   - Output directory: `.next`
4. Deploy with default settings

### AWS Amplify

For AWS-based infrastructure:

1. Connect your repository to AWS Amplify
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build:optimized`
   - Output directory: `.next`
3. Add environment variables in Amplify Console
4. Configure custom headers for security and caching

### Docker Deployment

For container-based deployments:

1. Use the included Dockerfile to build the image:
   ```
   docker build -t fluxori-frontend:latest .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```
   docker run -p 3000:3000 -e NODE_ENV=production fluxori-frontend:latest
   ```

3. For Kubernetes, use the provided deployment YAML files in the `/k8s` directory

## CI/CD Pipeline

The recommended CI/CD pipeline includes:

### GitHub Actions

The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

1. **CI Workflow** (`ci.yml`):
   - Triggered on pull requests
   - Runs linting, type checking, and tests
   - Performs bundle analysis
   - Checks for security vulnerabilities

2. **Deployment Workflow** (`deploy.yml`):
   - Triggered on merges to main branch
   - Runs the full build process
   - Deploys to staging environment
   - Runs smoke tests
   - Requires manual approval for production deployment

### Staging Deployment

- Every commit to the main branch deploys to staging
- Staging URL: `https://staging.fluxori.com`
- Includes feature flags for testing new features

### Production Deployment

- Requires manual approval after staging deployment
- Triggered via GitHub Actions or deployment platform
- Include version tagging for tracking releases

## Monitoring and Logging

The application includes built-in monitoring and logging:

### Error Reporting

The error reporting system is configured to send errors to the specified endpoint:

- Runtime errors are automatically captured
- Error context and breadcrumbs are included
- API failures are tracked
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ERROR_REPORTING_ENDPOINT` to your error service

### Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring is built into the application:

- Core Web Vitals are tracked
- Animation performance is monitored
- Resource timing metrics are collected
- Custom performance markers are included
- Adjust sampling with `NEXT_PUBLIC_PERFORMANCE_SAMPLING_RATE`

### Application Logs

For application logs, configure your deployment platform:

- Vercel provides integrated logging
- For AWS, configure CloudWatch Logs
- For Kubernetes, set up a logging stack (ELK, Loki, etc.)

## Rollback Procedures

In case of critical issues:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   - In Vercel: Use the "Rollback" button to return to a previous deployment
   - In AWS: Redeploy the previous version
   - In Kubernetes: Roll back to the previous deployment

2. **Gradual Rollout**:
   For major changes, use the built-in feature flags system to gradually roll out changes:
   ```
   // Example feature flag check
   if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE === 'true') {
     // New feature code
   } else {
     // Old feature code
   }
   ```

## Performance Optimization

The application includes several performance optimizations:

### CDN Configuration

Configure your CDN with the following cache headers:

- Static assets: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
- HTML pages: `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`

### Route-Based Code Splitting

The application uses route-based code splitting:

- Each page loads only the code it needs
- Dynamic imports for larger components
- Prefetching for commonly accessed routes

### Image Optimization

Next.js Image component is used for:

- Automatic WebP/AVIF format conversion
- Responsive image sizes
- Lazy loading
- Placeholder images during loading

### Animation Performance

GSAP animations are optimized:

- Hardware acceleration where appropriate
- Reduced motion paths for complex animations
- CSS variables for animation control
- User preference-based motion reduction

## Additional Notes

- The application requires Node.js 18+ for best performance
- Regular updates to dependencies are recommended
- Monitor bundle size and performance metrics after deployment
- Ensure CORS is properly configured on the backend API
- Third-party script loading is deferred to improve initial load times
