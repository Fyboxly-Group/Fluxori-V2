## Key Solutions

1. **Enhanced Component Type Declarations**
   - Created proper TypeScript interfaces for Chakra UI V3 components
   - Added proper HTML element inheritance in component props
   - Implemented ResponsiveValue<T> utility type for responsive styling

2. **Import Pattern Standardization**
   - Normalized all Chakra UI imports to use a consistent pattern
   - Fixed barrel imports vs direct component imports
   - Added compatibility layer for Chakra UI V3's new import structure

3. **Build Configuration Improvements**
   - Updated Next.js configuration to handle circular dependencies
   - Added transpilation options for better TypeScript compatibility
   - Created type definition files for external module interoperability

## Next Steps

While all TypeScript errors have been fixed, the build process still has some issues with circular dependencies and module resolution. The next phase should focus on standardizing the Chakra UI import approach throughout the codebase to completely resolve these issues.
