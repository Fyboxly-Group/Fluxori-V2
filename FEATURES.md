Last Updated: April 17, 2025 - Enhanced bundle optimization and performance tracking. Improved lazyLoad utility with priority-based loading, performance budgets, and retry mechanisms. Implemented link prefetching for common navigation paths and added enhanced error boundaries with recovery options. Created detailed bundle analysis reporting with dependency size tracking and optimization recommendations. Made significant progress in both testing and optimization aspects of the Testing & Production Preparation phase, improving both reliability and performance.
