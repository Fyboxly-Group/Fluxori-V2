## Summary

- Total TypeScript files: 584
- Production files: 512
- Test files: 72

## Type Safety Metrics

| Metric | Count | Files Affected | Severity |
|--------|-------|---------------|----------|
| `any` usage | 671 | Various | Medium |
| `@ts-ignore` usage | 30 | Various | High |
| `@ts-nocheck` usage in production | 0 | None | Critical |
| `@ts-nocheck` usage in tests | 39 | Test files only | Acceptable |

## Progress

- ✅ Successfully removed all `@ts-nocheck` directives from production code
- ✅ Pre-commit hook in place to prevent new `@ts-nocheck` directives in production
- ⚠️ There are still TypeScript errors to fix incrementally

## Recommendations

- Important: Address `@ts-ignore` comments with proper typings

- Recommended: Replace `any` with proper types or generic constraints

- Continue strengthening TypeScript adoption through template usage and type generation
- Fix remaining TypeScript errors in core modules first, then extend to all modules
