## Conclusion

This session has made substantial progress in the TypeScript migration effort, focusing on fixing all marketplace adapter files. The completion of Amazon, Takealot, and Shopify adapters represents a significant milestone in our migration journey. The creation of comprehensive type definitions for third-party APIs and the implementation of proper module registration systems will ensure type safety throughout the codebase.

With this session, we've successfully fixed all marketplace adapter files, which were a significant portion of the remaining TypeScript errors. This brings us much closer to completing the entire TypeScript migration effort.
