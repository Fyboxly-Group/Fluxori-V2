## How to Update This Document

After rebuilding a file:
1. Mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
2. Update the "Files Rebuilt" count
3. Run `npx tsc --noEmit | grep -c "error TS"` to get remaining errors
4. Update the "Last Updated" date

## Tips for Effective Rebuilding

1. **One File at a Time**: Focus on one file at a time, complete it, then move on
2. **Test as You Go**: Run TypeScript checks after each file rebuild
3. **Use Templates**: Use the template scripts for consistency
4. **Review Original Logic**: Check the backup files to understand the intended functionality
5. **Commit Often**: Make small, focused commits for each rebuilt file
