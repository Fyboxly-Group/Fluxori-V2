## Implementation Details

   - ✅ Dependency injection with Inversify
   - ✅ Logger service with structured logging

3. **Service Layer**

     - Warehouse-specific inventory management
     - Low stock alerts integration
     - Activity logging for inventory changes

### Template Usage

The following templates are available for rebuilding modules:
- `model.template.ts` - For MongoDB models with proper interface separation
- `controller.template.ts` - For API controllers with proper request/response typing
- `service.template.ts` - For business logic with dependency injection
- `route.template.ts` - For routing with OpenAPI documentation
- `schema.template.ts` - For validation schemas

### Module Generation

To generate a complete module:
```bash
node scripts/generate-module.js --name=EntityName
```

This creates:
- models/entityName.model.ts
- controllers/entityName.controller.ts
- services/entityName.service.ts
- schemas/entityName.schema.ts
- routes/entityName.routes.ts
- tests/entityName.service.test.ts
- index.ts

### Individual File Rebuilding

To rebuild a specific file:
```bash
node scripts/rebuild-file.js <template-type> <file-path> <resource-name> [--force]
```

Example:
```bash
node scripts/rebuild-file.js controller src/controllers/user.controller.ts User --force
```

### Type Generation

To generate TypeScript types from a model schema:
```bash
node scripts/generate-types-from-schema.js --model=path/to/model.js
```

## Blockers and Challenges

1. **Type Consistency** - Ensuring consistent typing across the codebase
2. **Legacy API Compatibility** - Maintaining backward compatibility with existing API contracts
3. **Multi-Warehouse Implementation** - Preserving multi-warehouse functionality during rebuild

| Controllers | ✅ 75% | ~200 | Major controllers rebuilt, some still need work |
| Authentication | ✅ 95% | ~20 | Nearly complete, minor fixes needed |
| Middleware | ✅ 90% | ~40 | Error middleware, validation middleware complete |
| Marketplace | ✅ 85% | ~120 | Amazon, Shopify, Takealot adapters complete |
| Order Ingestion | ✅ 90% | ~75 | Order model, ingestion services complete |
| Xero Integration | ✅ 85% | ~100 | Auth, invoices, services rebuilt |
| AI Features | ✅ 85% | ~50 | Fixed conversation service, RAG module |
| International Trade | ✅ 90% | ~30 | Fixed customs calculator, HS code lookup utility |
| Tests | 🔄 30% | ~450 | Many test files still have syntax errors |
| Utils | ✅ 90% | ~30 | Fixed email utility, error handling |

## Error Reduction Strategy

1. **Focus on Syntax Errors First**
   - Fix basic syntax issues in corrupted files
   - Leverage safe backups when available
   - Use rebuild scripts to recreate heavily corrupted files

2. **Target High-Impact Modules**
   - Prioritize core business functionality
   - Fix modules with the most errors first
   - Focus on files referenced by many other components

3. **Bulk Fixes for Common Patterns**
   - Use automated scripts for common error patterns
   - Create consistent type definitions for shared concepts
   - Standardize API response formats across the application

4. **Incremental Testing**
   - Run typescript check after each major fix
   - Track error count reduction over time
   - Focus on completely resolving errors in one module before moving to the next
