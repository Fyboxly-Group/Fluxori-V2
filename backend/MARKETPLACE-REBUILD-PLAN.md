# Marketplace Module TypeScript Rebuild Plan

## Progress Update

We have successfully implemented the first phase of the marketplace module rebuild with TypeScript, focusing on establishing the proper infrastructure and implementing the Amazon adapter:

### Completed
- ✅ Established proper marketplace adapter interface with TypeScript typings
- ✅ Created base marketplace adapter abstract class with common functionality
- ✅ Implemented fully typed Amazon adapter with SP-API integration
- ✅ Developed marketplace adapter factory with dependency injection
- ✅ Created marketplace adapter factory service for managing adaptors
- ✅ Updated inversify container configuration for the marketplace module
- ✅ Implemented standardized error handling with proper typing

## Next Steps

The following tasks are required to complete the marketplace module rebuild:

### 1. Shopify Adapter Implementation (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create ShopifyAdapter class extending BaseMarketplaceAdapter
- [ ] Implement Shopify API authentication and token management
- [ ] Develop product operations (get, create, update)
- [ ] Implement order operations (list, get, update)
- [ ] Add inventory synchronization functionality
- [ ] Create proper error mapping for Shopify API errors
- [ ] Write unit tests for ShopifyAdapter

### 2. Takealot Adapter Implementation (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create TakealotAdapter class extending BaseMarketplaceAdapter
- [ ] Implement Takealot API authentication
- [ ] Develop product operations (get, create, update)
- [ ] Implement order operations (list, get, update)
- [ ] Add inventory synchronization functionality
- [ ] Create proper error mapping for Takealot API errors
- [ ] Write unit tests for TakealotAdapter

### 3. Product Synchronization Service (3-4 days)
- [ ] Define interfaces for product synchronization
- [ ] Implement MarketplaceProductService with proper typing
- [ ] Create ProductMappingService for cross-marketplace mappings
- [ ] Develop concurrent synchronization capabilities
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement scheduling and rate limiting
- [ ] Create comprehensive logging with structured data
- [ ] Write unit tests for synchronization services

### 4. Order Ingestion Service (3-4 days)
- [ ] Define interfaces for order ingestion
- [ ] Implement MarketplaceOrderService with proper typing
- [ ] Create OrderMappingService for standardized order format
- [ ] Develop order status update mechanisms
- [ ] Implement fulfillment tracking
- [ ] Add notification system for new orders
- [ ] Create comprehensive logging with structured data
- [ ] Write unit tests for order ingestion services

### 5. Controller & Route Layer (2-3 days)
- [ ] Create MarketplaceController with proper request/response typing
- [ ] Implement marketplace configuration endpoints
- [ ] Add product management endpoints
- [ ] Develop order management endpoints
- [ ] Implement connection testing endpoints
- [ ] Create proper documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- [ ] Write integration tests for controller endpoints

## Implementation Plan

For each adapter, follow this implementation pattern:

1. Start with the credential interface and validation
2. Implement API client with proper error handling
3. Create product-related operations
4. Add order-related operations
5. Implement inventory synchronization
6. Add category and attribute operations
7. Create proper error mapping
8. Write tests for core functionality

## Key Design Principles

Throughout the implementation, maintain these principles:

1. **TypeScript First**: Design with TypeScript types from the beginning
2. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with proper typing
3. **Testability**: Design for easy mocking and testing
4. **Dependency Injection**: Use container for managing dependencies
5. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns from the Amazon adapter
6. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments

## Implementation Strategy

- Work on the adapters in parallel by focusing on the same operations across all adapters
- Start with the most critical operations (product and order management)
- Hold regular cross-checks to ensure consistency across adapters
- Maintain a test-driven approach for core functionality

## Expected Completion Timeline

- Shopify Adapter: 1 week
- Takealot Adapter: 1 week
- Synchronization Services: 1-2 weeks
- Controller & Route Layer: 1 week

Total estimated timeline: 4-5 weeks
