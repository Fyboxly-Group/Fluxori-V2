# TypeScript Migration Progress

This document tracks our progress in improving TypeScript adoption throughout the Fluxori-V2 backend codebase, gradually removing @ts-nocheck pragmas and replacing them with proper TypeScript types.

## Implementation Plan Overview

We're following a systematic approach to improving TypeScript adoption:

1. Phase 1: Foundation Setup
   - ✅ Enhance mongo-util-types.ts with comprehensive utilities
   - ✅ Create express-extensions.ts with request/response utilities
   - ✅ Create promise-utils.ts for Promise.allSettled handling
   - ✅ Create scheduler-mock.ts for cloud scheduler integration
   - ✅ Document TypeScript patterns and best practices

2. Phase 2: Fix Critical Modules
   - ✅ Sync Orchestrator Module
   - ✅ Product Ingestion Module
   - ✅ Order Ingestion Service
   - ✅ Connection Module

3. Phase 3: Systematic Error Fixing
   - ⬜ Property Access Errors
   - ⬜ Type Mismatch Errors
   - ⬜ MongoDB ObjectId Errors
   - ⬜ Update Test Files

4. Phase 4: Monitoring and Maintenance
   - ⬜ TypeScript Quality Dashboard
   - ✅ Documentation and Training
   - ⬜ Gradual Strictness Improvement

## Current Progress

## Known Issues

- Some files in the xero-connector module may need special handling due to third-party library type issues
- Express request typing in controllers needs a consistent approach across the codebase
- We need to improve our utility types for mongoose schema methods and virtuals
- Third-party libraries without proper TypeScript definitions require custom declaration files
