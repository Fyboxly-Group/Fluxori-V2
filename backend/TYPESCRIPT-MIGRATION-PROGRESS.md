## Next Steps

1. Complete International Trade module TypeScript conversion
2. Enhance AI-CS-Agent module with TypeScript support
3. Rebuild Notifications module with proper typing
4. Implement enhanced TypeScript validation for all API endpoints
5. Add comprehensive TypeScript tests for converted modules

## Lessons Learned

1. **Rebuild over Fix**: Rebuilding modules from scratch with proper TypeScript is more effective than fixing existing code
2. **Interface-First Development**: Starting with interface definitions creates a clearer development path
3. **Incremental Conversion**: Focusing on one module at a time yields better results than a big-bang approach
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is essential for type safety
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments enhance development experience

## Best Practices Established

1. **Type-Safe Services**: All services should have properly typed methods and parameters
2. **Interface-Based Design**: Use interfaces for complex types and method signatures
3. **Error Narrowing**: Implement proper error handling with type narrowing
4. **Validation Schemas**: Define validation schemas with TypeScript interfaces
5. **Repository Pattern**: Use repository pattern for data access with proper type safety
