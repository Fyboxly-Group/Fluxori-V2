### Migration and Setup

Transitioning to multi-warehouse inventory is simple:

1. Run the provided setup script:
   ```
   node setup-multi-warehouse.js
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Create a default warehouse if none exists
   - Migrate existing inventory data to the warehouse structure
   - Set up the reorder point check scheduler

### Configuration Options

Configure the system to match your specific needs:

- Set reorder check frequency using `INVENTORY_REORDER_CHECK_CRON` in your `.env` file
- Default warehouse settings can be customized during setup
- Per-warehouse reorder points can be set via the API

### Best Practices

- Create warehouses that reflect your physical locations
- Set accurate reorder points for each item in each warehouse
- Use inventory transfers to keep stock balanced across locations
- Review low stock alerts regularly to prevent stockouts

### Known Issues

- Historical inventory reports may not show warehouse breakdowns for data prior to this update
- Bulk operations currently process one warehouse at a time

### Future Enhancements

We're already working on:

- Advanced warehouse-specific reporting
