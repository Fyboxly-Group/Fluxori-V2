# Utility Services Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing the remaining utility services in the Fluxori-V2 backend project. After completing the User Management and Organization Management modules, the next step is to implement file storage and PDF generation services.

## Current Status

As of May 5, 2025, we have completed:

- ✅ User Management module with TypeScript support
- ✅ Organization Management module with TypeScript support
- ✅ Role-based access control with TypeScript support
- ✅ External integrations (Xero invoice integration)

Remaining items to implement:

- ⏱️ File Storage service
- ⏱️ PDF Generation service

## Implementation Plan

### 1. File Storage Service

**Objective**: Create a robust, type-safe file storage service to handle file uploads, downloads, and management.

**Key Features**:
- Type-safe file storage operations
- Support for multiple storage providers (local, S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Proper error handling with TypeScript
- Access control based on organization permissions
- File metadata management
- Versioning support
- Secure URL generation for access

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Define interfaces for file storage operations
2. Create a base storage provider interface
3. Implement concrete providers for local and cloud storage
4. Implement file metadata storage in the database
5. Create file access control with organization boundaries
6. Implement secure URL generation
7. Build file versioning support
8. Create file management controller with TypeScript

### 2. PDF Generation Service

**Objective**: Create a flexible, type-safe PDF generation service for reports, invoices, and other documents.

**Key Features**:
- Type-safe PDF generation API
- Template-based document generation
- Support for dynamic content and styling
- Localization support
- Proper error handling with TypeScript
- Integration with file storage for persistence
- Preview capabilities
- Batch generation support

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Define interfaces for PDF generation
2. Create a template engine with TypeScript support
3. Implement PDF rendering with proper typing
4. Create a template repository for commonly used documents
5. Implement styling and branding options
6. Add support for dynamic content generation
7. Integrate with file storage service
8. Create PDF generation controller with TypeScript

## Technical Approach

1. **Interface-First Design**: We'll start by defining comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all services.

2. **Dependency Injection**: We'll continue using the DI approach established in other modules.

3. **Provider Pattern**: For file storage, we'll use a provider pattern to support multiple backends.

4. **Template System**: For PDF generation, we'll implement a template system with TypeScript typing.

5. **Testing Strategy**: We'll create unit tests for both services, with mock providers for cloud services.

## Timeline

**File Storage Service**: 3 days
**PDF Generation Service**: 2 days
**Integration & Testing**: 1 day

**Total**: 6 days

## Next Steps

1. Start with the File Storage service implementation
2. Move on to PDF Generation service
3. Document both services in FEATURES.md
4. Update REBUILD-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md after completion
